<p><font face=tahoma><i>Identity Theft</i></font>
<br><font face=tahoma>Lt. Jessa Mendoza had experienced identity theft which led to many case reports about her. She was shocked upon hearing the news that
<br>her name and tax identification number were listed in the incorporation papers of 193 corporations, 102 of which sounded foreign
<br>to her. Eventually, she recalled during a Senate probe on illegal offshore gaming operators (POGOs) how she was slapped with cases
<br>involving companies whose names were totally unknown to her.</p>
<p><i>Disinformation</i>
<br>A report published on May 8 2022, stated that, "On Monday, voters in the Philippines will pick the nation's next president - amid a tide
<br>a tide of falsehoods and social media lies."
<br>"Jon - not his real name - is part of an industry that could be crucial to the selection of the next president of the Philippines. He says
<br>he's been working most days from 10:00 to 3:00, managing hundreds of Facebook pages and fake profiles and their campaigns. He says his
<br>customers include governors, congressmen and mayors. He uses fake IDs to set up multiple accounts on Facebook."</p>
</p>"Jon is part of this disinformation ecosystem. He says he has around 30 "trolls" working directly for him. Their aim is to boost support
<br>for their clients, even if it means spreading falsehoods."</p>

<br>culture. No significant censorship was found during th testing of instant mesaging apps and circumvention tools, with the exception of Psiphon
<br>which recorded high anomalies and should be investigated further.</p>
